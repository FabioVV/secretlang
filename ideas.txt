1 - Add error correction suggestion:
context aware suggestions
spelling checking with Levenshtein Distance


 - Change error text from the current expected both to be, got ? to this: expect expectec both to be ?, but got ? and ?

 - Just go around parsing showing the errors and do not append to a list of errors, instead set a field hadError, that if its value is true, do not compile the program

Language ideas

2.1 - other ideas

// some stupid ideas.....

module math
    @imports("math_helpers.ext") // imports as math_helpers.something
    const mthp = @imports("math_helpers.ext") // imports as mthp.something

end

maybe allow submodules?
